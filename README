This is pretty self-explanatory to me, but if it isn't to you:

You will need Plan 9 from User Space, here: https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/ .

You also will need the language spec, here: https://hub.darcs.net/jcast/globalscript-spec (Darcs Hub) or here: https://hub.darcs.net/jcast/globalscript-spec (GitHub).
The language spec should go in a parallel directory to this checkout.

Set

    HSGLOBALSCRIPT=`pwd`
    GS_SPEC=whereever you put the globalscript-spec checkout

Then run

    sh install-prereqs.sh
    sh configure
    ./test-all

to test and build this checkout.

To run a Global Script program, wrap it in

import GSI.Env (runGSProgram)
$gsimports
 
main = runGSProgram $ [gs:value|
    -- Global Script code goes here
|]

, save that to a .hsgs file, then run

    $HSGLOBALSCRIPT/bin/hsgs2hs $foo.hsgs
    ghc `$HSGLOBALSCRIPT/ghcoptions` -i$HSGLOBALSCRIPT/src/libgsi --make foo.hs -o foo
    ./foo

to compile and run it.
