   * you pay the qualifying project which developed it
     * $10/month or $120/year for each developer who works on those programs, and

Section V. Definitions

 * "This implementation" means
   * an unmodified copy of this implementation as distributed by Global Script Development Labs, or
   * a copy of this implementation compiled by you or by a third party, with only minimal porting changes made to it.

 * A "qualifying modified version of this implementation" means
   * a modified version of this implementation developed and distributed by a qualifying project, or
   * a copy of such a version compiled by you or by a third party, with only minimal porting changes made to it.
   A reference to "the qualifying project", after a reference to a qualifying modified version, means the project that ddeveloped and distributed the modified version.

 * A "qualifying project" means an open-source project which
   * develops a modified version of this implementation, or software incorporating such a modified version,
   * distributes it to the general public, and
   * ensures that the individual developer of all software incorporated into its public release is paid
     * at least 30USD / hour spent developing the modification, or
     * at least 1200USD for each week during which the developer worked on the modification.
   Payment need not be tendered by the qualifying project as long as the project ensures that payment is tendered by someone.

 * An "individual developer" means the person who actually made the modification to the software,
   regardless of any work-for-hire laws that may be in place.
